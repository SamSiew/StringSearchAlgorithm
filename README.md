# StringSearchAlgorithm

Boyer-Moore algorithm: Algorithm that searches for text occurrences in string by performing explicit character comparisons at different alignments.</br>
Z Algorithm: Algorithm which finds all occurrences of a pattern in a text in linear time.</br>
Knuth-Morris-Pratt: Algorithm that is used to search substring (W) in a given string (S) by minimize the amount of backtracking when a character of W does not match with that of S.
